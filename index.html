<h3>Research and Publications</h3>
<p>During 2022, I involved in different research projects in collaboration with Harvard in Computational Social Science and Quantitative Finance.</p>
<p>In late 2020/early 2021, I had the valuable experience to research on time-series prediction for infectious disease modelling using Neural Network. Inspired by Neural ODE structure, we produced interesting results in Black Sigatoka prediction. Our work won <a href="https://www.projectx2020.com/">Project X 2020</a>, an international research competition for undergraduate with the theme this year being 'Climate Change' and was awarded $20000. It is proudly presented on <a href="https://www.utoronto.ca/news/prize-winning-u-t-student-team-uses-ai-beat-banana-blight">University of Toronto's website</a>, <a href="https://web.cs.toronto.edu/news-events/news/how-to-beat-banana-blight-prize-winning-u-of-t-student-team-turns-to-novel-neural-network">UofT Department of Computer Science's website</a>, and the school's largest student-run newspaper - <a href="https://thevarsity.ca/2021/01/31/u-of-t-ai-conference-highlights-use-of-machine-learning-to-address-the-climate-crisis/?fbclid=IwAR1SEmYQSDbnNUrBu8yMl_rB-3I5QrvJ0uf3Yrs3UuzDxHq0wMNTkIPask0">The Varsity</a>. Our work is presented at ICML 2021 Climate Change AI Workshop.</p>
